A lightweight web application for controlling a custom Discord music bot.

The goal is to provide a simple, user-friendly way to manage audio during TTRPG sessions on Discord—without getting in the way. Basic features like volume control, simultaneous audio playback (e.g., weather effects and background music), and queue management can significantly enhance the experience with minimal effort—especially if the interface is streamlined. This is particularly important for a GM who’s already juggling a hundred and one things during a session.
