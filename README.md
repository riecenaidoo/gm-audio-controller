Catalogue Builder - Create catalogues to organise a large number of playlists. 

## TODO

### Page Changing

- There probably needs to be  a service to handle page changes. Something in-between to fetch the required data and pass it on to the routed page. There might be a pattern for this, but I should see what I can come up with first.
  - Only route to the page once the minimum data required to present the page has been fetched?
  - rm `EMPTY_PLAYLIST` & `EMPTY_SONG` usages.

### Components
